             Why was Robin Hood Gardens demolished?
             Poorly maintained buildings aged badly. Many have met the same fate as Robin Hood                   Gardens. Far from creating an urban utopia, Robin Hood Gardens came to be synonymous                with vandalism and crime. Terrible upkeep made the apartment units undesirable                      places to live
             Robin Hood Gardens estate in Poplar, East London, has been dubbed "streets of the sky" after it was built with walkways connecting neighbours. Opened in 1972 as social housing, it is now set for demolition - with only one local refusing to budge.
             Robin Hood Gardens, located in Poplar, East London, is a nationally important and internationally recognised work of Brutalist architecture. Completed in 1972, the building was designed by Alison (1928 –1993) and Peter Smithson (1923 – 2003), British architects of lasting international reputation.
             Robin Hood probably became an outlaw by killing a deer on a wager. Then he had slain one of the king's foresters who threatened his life. A price was set on Robin's head, and he went into hiding. Soon there gathered about him other bold men who had been outlawed or deprived of their inheritances.
